Binaries
========

  **Please note this project is currently under heavy development. It should not be used in production.**

**This instruction set is meant for hackers who want to try out Docker on a variety of environments.**

Right now, the officially supported distributions are:

- :ref:`ubuntu_precise`
- :ref:`ubuntu_raring`


But we know people have had success running it under

- Debian
- Suse
- :ref:`arch_linux`


Dependencies:
-------------

* 3.8 Kernel (read more about :ref:`kernel`)
* AUFS filesystem support
* lxc
* xz-utils

Get the docker binary:
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    wget http://get.docker.io/builds/Linux/x86_64/docker-latest.tgz
    tar -xf docker-latest.tgz


Run the docker daemon
---------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # start the docker in daemon mode from the directory you unpacked
    sudo ./docker -d &


Run your first container!
-------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # check your docker version
    ./docker version

    # run a container and open an interactive shell in the container
    ./docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash



Continue with the :ref:`hello_world` example.
